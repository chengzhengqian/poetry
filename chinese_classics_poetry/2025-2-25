Excerpt from Book I, The Prelude, by William Wordsworth
When he had left the mountains and received
On his smooth breast the shadow of those towers
That yet survive, a shattered monument
Of feudal sway, the bright blue river passed
Along the margin of our terrace walk;
A tempting playmate whom we dearly loved.
Oh, many a time have I, a five years' child,
In a small mill-race severed from his stream,
Made one long bathing of a summer's day;
Basked in the sun, and plunged and basked again
Alternate, all a summer's day, or scoured
The sandy fields, leaping through flowery groves
Of yellow ragwort; or when rock and hill,
The woods, and distant Skiddaw's lofty height,
Were bronzed with deepest radiance, stood alone
Beneath the sky, as if I had been born
On Indian plains, and from my mother's hut
Had run abroad in wantonness, to sport
A naked savage, in the thunder shower.

意譯 養心主人
長河出眾嶺，殘壘影清波。
浴洗霞明麗，嬉游樹婆娑。
雲沉歸鳥盡，日落亂山多。
心與六龍駕，悠悠閱嵯峨。

長河出眾嶺，殘壘影清波。
浴洗霞明麗，嬉游樹婆娑。
雲沉歸鳥盡，日落亂山多。
心與天風駕，悠悠閱嵯峨。
