The Full Text of “When We Two Parted”
When we two parted   In silence and tears,
Half broken-hearted   To sever for years,
Pale grew thy cheek and cold,   Colder thy kiss;
Truly that hour foretold   Sorrow to this.

The dew of the morning   Sunk chill on my brow—
It felt like the warning   Of what I feel now.
Thy vows are all broken,   And light is thy fame;
I hear thy name spoken,   And share in its shame.

They name thee before me,   A knell to mine ear;
A shudder comes o'er me—   Why wert thou so dear?
They know not I knew thee,   Who knew thee too well—
Long, long shall I rue thee,   Too deeply to tell.

In secret we met—   In silence I grieve,
That thy heart could forget,   Thy spirit deceive.
If I should meet thee   After long years,
How should I greet thee?—   With silence and tears.


南浦揮玉箸，傷心別經年。
霧頰吹晨氣，霜吻映寒天。

清露濕眉宇，今日讖苦悲。
山盟與海誓，夢罷盡相違。

或聞語君名，哀名曾惠聽。
開落無人見，豈知舊痴情。

邂逅西園徑，粉蝶迷花薰。
多年如重遇，唯剩此寒心。
