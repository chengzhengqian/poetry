蘇幕遮 周邦彥

燎沉香，消溽暑。
鳥雀呼晴，侵曉窺檐語。
葉上初陽乾宿雨、水面清圓，一一風荷舉。

故鄉遙，何日去。
家住吳門，久作長安旅。
五月漁郎相憶否。小楫輕舟，夢入芙蓉浦。


Igniting agarwood, I turn the time
of humid summer into sweet relieves.
Dawn's birds all whisper in a nimble rhyme,
to cheer the cease of overnight rain on eaves.

Dew dries on lotus leaves in morning's glow,
when fragrant breeze caress the willow's pond;
Green round umbrellas in a swaying show,
Dance high and low, with winds in gentle bond.

When shall I return to my distant home?
For years, I've dwelled here as a passing guest.
In hometown' pond, where childhood joys would roam,
May's fishing boats still drift 'twixt east and west?

A dream of home dispels all sighs and grieves,
When swift yacht glides through shades of lotus leaves.
