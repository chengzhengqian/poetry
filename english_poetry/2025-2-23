When I am painting
When I am painting, all become so quiet,
So far away from where mind comprehends.
There's no chattering, or quarrel, or riot,
But yet the desire for beauty extends.

The faint insight echos from ancient songs:
A white egret among red falling leaves,
stirred by silver drops jumping over stones,
vanished into endless mist with left grieves.

Then I try best to catch this short sweat dream,
with pigment, with brush, with a husty hand.
The orginally dumb canvas, now seem
carry the serence scene, a untouched land.

But once this desire for beauty is fullied,
the joy for another will trigger another dream.

When I Am Painting
When I am painting, all is hushed and still,
Far from the realms my mind can comprehend.
No chatter, quarrel, nor riot tries my will,
While beauty's calls through endless time extend.

A whisper lingers from words of Wang Wei: 
A white egret among the crimson leaves,
With silver droplets dancing in the spray,
Into the mist it fades, and my heart grieves.

I strive to capture this ephemeral dream,
With pigment, brush, and hand that's swift and free.
The silent canvas traps this fleeting theme,
A tranquil world untouched by time's decree.

But once this thirst for beauty is fulfilled,
Creation's spark ignites yet one more thrill.


Notes:
"Words of Wang Wei" refers to a poem from the "Anthology of Wangchuan".
