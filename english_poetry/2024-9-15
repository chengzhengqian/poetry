六丑 （薔薇謝後作） （周邦彥）


正單衣試酒，悵客裏、光陰虛擲。
願春暫留，春歸如過翼，一去無跡。
為問花何在？夜來風雨，葬楚宮傾國。
釵鈿墮處遺香澤，亂點桃蹊，輕翻柳陌。
多情為誰追惜？但蜂媒蝶使，時叩窗槅。

東園岑寂，漸朦朧暗碧，靜繞珍叢底。
成嘆息：長條故惹行客，似牽衣待話，別情無極。
殘英小、強簪巾幘，終不似、一朵釵頭顫裊，向人欹側。
漂流處、莫趁潮汐，恐斷紅、尚有相思字，何由見得？

The time is thrown in vain when spring is passed,
As flying birds, that vanished with no trace.
A night of rain washed all roses in blast,
Like burying the beauty with deep hates:

The fragrance from the dropped graceful hairpin,
Scatters along the path of peach and willow trees.
No one will weep her death even in  thin,
But only butterflies and busy bees.

The garden now is quiet without the roses.
Yet branches drag me whispering sorrow,
Remaining little flowers try old poses,
not like previous pretty and bright show.

When in river, not drift towards the tides!
As the pedals might be carried with sighs.

In vain we cast the hours as spring has passed,
Like birds that vanish, leaving not a trace.
Night's rain has washed the roses in its blast,
As if to bury love, preserve her grace.

The fragrance of  her fallen golden pin,
Recalls strewn blossoms in the willow's shade.
None wept her passing, kith nor distant kin,
Where busy bees and  butterflies still played.

The garden lies in silence, roseless now.
Yet branches drag me, whispering their woe,
The few remaining blooms make their last bow,
A faded echo of their former show.

When caught in rivers, fight the pulling tide,
For petals might bear words of love inside.
