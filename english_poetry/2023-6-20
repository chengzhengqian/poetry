高陽台·接葉巢鶯，是南宋詞人張炎在宋亡國後的詞作。

接葉巢鶯，平波卷絮，斷橋斜日歸船。
能幾番游？看花又是明年。
東風且伴薔薇住，到薔薇、春已堪憐。
更悽然，萬綠西泠，一抹荒煙。
當年燕子知何處？但苔深韋曲，草暗斜川。
見說新愁，如今也到鷗邊。
無心再續笙歌夢，掩重門、淺醉閒眠。
莫開簾。怕見飛花，怕聽啼鵑。


Boat backs when falling sun shines on West Lake,
and soft ripples disturb the leaves' shadow.
How many more happiness could I take?
when the next spring wanders her step too slow.

There might be some reminiscence in roses,
yet with searching the spring has nought remain.
Frozen Bridge thousands green trees juxtaposes,
covered with melancholy mist in vain.

Where is the swallow bird I deeply know?
But moss and grass conquer the burried glories.
Even sand gull's white hair does the sorrow show,
and I fear happy music with cheerful stories.

Sadness is a blessing for happy eyes;
Happiness is a curse when my heart dies.


Boat backs when falling sun shines on West Lake,
with quiet ripples disturbing leaves' shadow.
How many more happy days could I take?
when the next spring wanders her feet too slow.
There might be some reminiscence in roses;
upon searching pity petals remain.
Frozen Bridge thousands green trees juxtaposes,
covered with melancholy mist in vain.
Where is the swallow bird I deeply know?
But moss and grass conquer the burried glories.
Even sand gull's white hair does the sorrow show,
and I fear happy music with cheerful stories.
    Sadness is a blessing for happy eyes;
    Happiness is a curse when my heart dies.








flower season is next year.
Zephyros might with multifloras stay,
yet when searching, roses nearly dissappear.
Not to say that mist covers the waste land,
and old palace is hidden in green trees .
Where does the familiar swallow stand?
but moss and grass replace decayed glories.

The boat retreats as the sun sets on  West Lake,
Soft ripples disturb the shadows of leaves.
How much more happiness could I take?
When spring's arrival tarries, and heart grieves?

Perhaps some fragrance lingers in the rose,
Yet searching reveals spring's empty domain.
Frozen Bridge lines where green trees juxtapose,
Covered with melancholy mist in vain.

Where is the swallow that I used to know?
Thick Moss and grass now shroud the buried glories.
Even sand gull's white feathers show deep woe,
And I fear joyful songs and cheerful stories.

Sadness is a blessing for happy eyes;
Happiness is a curse when my heart dies.

The boat retreats as sunset gilds on West Lake,
Soft ripples disturb the shadows of leaves.
How much more happiness could I take?
When spring's arrival tarries, my heart grieves.

Perhaps some fragrance lingers in the rose,
Yet searching yields but spring's deserted realm.
Frozen Bridge lines where green trees juxtapose,
brushed in the melancholy's misty helm.

Where flies the swallow that I once did know?
Thick Moss and grass now shrouded the buried glories.
Even sand gull's white hairs betray deep woe,
I shun the mirth of songs and cheerful stories.

For joyful eyes, sadness may blessing bring;
When heart expires, happiness loses sting.
