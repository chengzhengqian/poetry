瑣寒窗 周邦彥
暗柳啼鴉，單衣佇立，小簾朱戶。
桐花半畝，靜鎖一庭愁雨。
灑空階、夜闌未休，故人剪燭西窗語。
似楚江暝宿，風燈零亂，少年羈旅。

遲暮，嬉游處。
正店舍無煙，禁城百五。
旗亭喚酒，付與高陽儔侶。
想東園、桃李自春，小唇秀靨今在否？
到歸時、定有殘英，待客攜樽俎。



I stand alone in tranquil yard, where crows
Call mournfully through willow's dampened leaves.
Sycamores bloom in rain; my spirit flows
along each droplet's plop, counting its grieves.

I think of candlelight that flickered bright
Upon our small boat on the River Chu,
Between stark  mountains in that rain-soaked night.
We spoke of dreams -- How swfit those seasons flew!

Where are you, my friend, as we grew old?
The places we once treasured lie wild and bare.
Fine wine, without you, tastes like sorrow's cold,
While garden blooms breathe nothing but despair.

Does that sweet girl we cherished linger there?
Might we drink once more in spring's gentle air.
