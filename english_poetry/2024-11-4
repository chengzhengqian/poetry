瑣寒窗 周邦彥
暗柳啼鴉，單衣佇立，小簾朱戶。
桐花半畝，靜鎖一庭愁雨。
灑空階、夜闌未休，故人剪燭西窗語。
似楚江暝宿，風燈零亂，少年羈旅。

遲暮，嬉游處。
正店舍無煙，禁城百五。
旗亭喚酒，付與高陽儔侶。
想東園、桃李自春，小唇秀靨今在否？
到歸時、定有殘英，待客攜樽俎。



I stand alone in tranquil yard, where crows
Cry sadly 'midst the willow's moist green leaves.
Sycamore blooms in rain, when faint time flows
Through overnight's soft plop, counting my grieves.

Then I recalled the candle's flickering light,
In small boat drifting on the river of Chu,
between cold sharp mountains in raining night,
talking about our dreams -- so many year flew!

Where are you, my friend, when time worn us old?
The places we joyed now are pieces of wilderness.
Fine wine, without you, tastes as sorrow's cold,
And flowers in the garden call sadness.

    Does the girl we deeply loved still lives there?
    Might we drink again, in spring's kissing air.
