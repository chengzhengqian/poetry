瑣寒窗 周邦彥
暗柳啼鴉，單衣佇立，小簾朱戶。
桐花半畝，靜鎖一庭愁雨。
灑空階、夜闌未休，故人剪燭西窗語。
似楚江暝宿，風燈零亂，少年羈旅。

遲暮，嬉游處。
正店舍無煙，禁城百五。
旗亭喚酒，付與高陽儔侶。
想東園、桃李自春，小唇秀靨今在否？
到歸時、定有殘英，待客攜樽俎。



I stand alone in tranquil yard, where crows
Call mournfully through willow's weeping leaves.
Sycamores bloom in rain; my spirit flows
with every droplet's fall, counting my grieves.

I think of candlelight that flickered bright
Within our boat adrift on River Chu,
Between tall mountains in that misty night.
We shared our dreams -- how swift those seasons flew!

Where are you now, dear friend, as years unfold?
The places we once treasured, wild and strange.
Fine wine, without you, turns to sorrow's cold,
While garden blooms in solitude derange.

Does that sweet girl we cherished linger there?
To drink once more in spring's soft fragrant air.
