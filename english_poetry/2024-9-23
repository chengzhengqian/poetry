賀新郎（綠樹聽鵜鴂） （別茂嘉十二弟，鵜鴂、杜鵑實兩種，見離騷補注。）

綠樹聽鵜鴂
更那堪 鷓鴣聲住 杜鵑聲切
啼到春歸無尋處 苦恨芳菲都歇
算未抵 人間離別
馬上琵琶關塞黑 更長門 翠輦辭金闕
看燕燕 送歸妾

將軍百戰身名裂
向河梁 回頭萬里 故人長絕
易水蕭蕭西風冷 滿座衣冠似雪
正壯士 悲歌未徹
啼鳥還知如許恨 料不啼清淚長啼血
誰共我 醉明月


When Cuckoos in bright green trees sorrow tell,
The sounds are so sad all flowers perish.
Yet saddest thing is forever farewell,
Through infinite space and time to cherish.

She wed for country's peace, alone away,
Her Pipa's songs with the dark sand-storm blends,
While her parents and friends in hometown stay,
She suffers night's swords and day's scorns, without ends.

He fights for country's glories, win and loss.
Now called traiter, who battled with last steam.
Though loyalty could not stand faint fate's toss,
He loves his homeland, soaring back in dream.

If birds could undertand sorrow of depart,
They sing with blood to tell woes of  my heart.
