賀新郎（綠樹聽鵜鴂） （別茂嘉十二弟，鵜鴂、杜鵑實兩種，見離騷補注。）

綠樹聽鵜鴂
更那堪 鷓鴣聲住 杜鵑聲切
啼到春歸無尋處 苦恨芳菲都歇
算未抵 人間離別
馬上琵琶關塞黑 更長門 翠輦辭金闕
看燕燕 送歸妾

將軍百戰身名裂
向河梁 回頭萬里 故人長絕
易水蕭蕭西風冷 滿座衣冠似雪
正壯士 悲歌未徹
啼鳥還知如許恨 料不啼清淚長啼血
誰共我 醉明月


When cuckoos in bright verdant trees lament,
Their mournful cries make springtime flowers fall.
Yet saddest still is endlss banishment,
Through boundless space and time, a constant call.

She weds for country's peace, to lands unknown,
Her pipa's songs with raging sandstorm blend,
While kith and kin in distant hometown moan,
She bears night's swords and day's scorns without end.

He fights for glory, through wins and losses,
Now branded traitor who gave all in vain.
Though loyalty bows to fate's faint tosses,
His dreams still soar to homeland once again.

If birds could feel this sorrow's piercing smart,
They'd sing with blood the woes that weep my heart.
