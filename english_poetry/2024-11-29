八六子 秦觀

倚危亭。恨如芳草，萋萋刬盡還生。
念柳外青驄別後，水邊紅袂分時，愴然暗驚。

無端天與娉婷。夜月一簾幽夢，春風十里柔情。
怎奈向、歡娛漸隨流水，素弦聲斷，翠綃香減，那堪片片飛花弄晚，蒙蒙殘雨籠晴。
正銷凝。黃鸝又啼數聲。


Against the pavilion's cold pillar, my soul drifts,
When sorrow grows like grass untamed in spring,
A restless ache that through my spirit lifts--
She vannished in crimson, midst willow's wing.

Who blessed her with such beauty, pure and fleet,
To transform weary nights of pallid moon
Into a dream where fragrant blossoms meet--
Yet joy, a stream that ebbs away too soon.

Now silent harp strings lie beneath thick dust,
while her handkerchief's fragrance wanes slow,
Like falling flowers, butterflies' last gust,
Soft misty rain embroidering silent woe.

I lost myself within vanished dream's past,
Where birds sing sad, my heart an empty cast.
