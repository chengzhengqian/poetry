八六子 秦觀

倚危亭。恨如芳草，萋萋刬盡還生。
念柳外青驄別後，水邊紅袂分時，愴然暗驚。

無端天與娉婷。夜月一簾幽夢，春風十里柔情。
怎奈向、歡娛漸隨流水，素弦聲斷，翠綃香減，那堪片片飛花弄晚，蒙蒙殘雨籠晴。
正銷凝。黃鸝又啼數聲。


Against pavilion's cold pillar, soul strays,
When sorrow grows, like endless grass in spring,
disturbs my heart, despite of mowed away:
Then she vannished in red, midst willow's green.

Who endows her that beauty, pure still and swift,
To render tedious nights with watery moon
Into a dream that fragrant flowers drift.
Yet happiness is flow that fades so soon.

Now strings of harp are covered in thick dust,
fragrance of her handkerchief  fades slow
The flowers fall like butterflies in dusk,
while misty rain weaves my deep sorrow.

I lost my mind recalling that dreamy past,
Birds sadly sing, my heart to empty cast.
