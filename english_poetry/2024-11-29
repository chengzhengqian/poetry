八六子 秦觀

倚危亭。恨如芳草，萋萋刬盡還生。
念柳外青驄別後，水邊紅袂分時，愴然暗驚。

無端天與娉婷。夜月一簾幽夢，春風十里柔情。
怎奈向、歡娛漸隨流水，素弦聲斷，翠綃香減，那堪片片飛花弄晚，蒙蒙殘雨籠晴。
正銷凝。黃鸝又啼數聲。


Against the pavilion's cold pillar, my soul drifts,
When sorrow grows like grass untamed in spring,
A restless ache that through my spirit lifts,
when she vannished in red, midst willow's wing.

Who granted her that beauty, pure and swift,
To render tedious nights with watery moon
Into a dream that fragrant flowers drift--
Yet happiness, a flow that fades too soon.

Now harp strings lie beneath a shroud of dust,
The fragrance of her handkerchief wanes slow,
As flowers falling, butterflies' last gust,
The misty rain embroiders silent woe.

I lost my mind, recalling that dream's past,
Where birds sing sad, my heart an empty cast.
