蘭陵王 柳
柳陰直，煙裡絲絲弄碧。隋堤上、曾見幾番，拂水飄綿送行色。登臨望故國，誰識、京華倦客？長亭路、年去歲來，應折柔條過千尺。
閒尋舊蹤跡。又酒趁哀絃，燈照離席，梨花榆火催寒食。愁一箭風快，半篙波暖。回頭迢遞便數驛，望人在天北。
淒惻，恨堆積！漸別浦縈回，津堠岑寂。斜陽冉冉春無極。念月榭攜手，露橋聞笛。沉思前事，似夢裏、淚暗滴。

The weeping willow's shade extends along
The Sui Embankment, weaving mist in green.
So many times I've heard the farewell song,
As slender twigs brush waves, the heart still keen.

Who knows my heart, in city's weary strife,
Where wistful souls with sorrowed branches sigh?
Yet still it pains, recalling that sweet life--
The day you left, and still I wonder why.

The wine was warm, but swift thy boat took flight,
Like arrows speeding far from where we lay.
Thou vanished, leaving trails of scarlet light
Upon the winding river of late May.

The path we walked beneath the moon's cold gleam
Still haunts me now, though thou art but a dream.
