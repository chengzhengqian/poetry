賀新郎（賦琵琶） 辛棄疾
鳳尾龍香撥
自開元 霓裳曲罷 幾番風月
最苦潯陽江頭客 畫舸亭亭待發
記出塞 黃雲堆雪
馬上離愁三萬里 望昭陽 宮殿孤鴻沒
弦解語 恨難說

遼陽驛使音塵絕
瑣窗寒 輕攏慢捻 淚珠盈睫
推手含情還卻手 一抹梁州哀徹
千古事 雲飛煙滅
賀老定場無消息 想沉香亭北繁華歇
彈到此 為嗚咽


How much more romance Pipa's music stirred?
When song of Rainbow Dress warned empire's fall.
The exiled poet's woes in moonlight were spurred,
As the lone lady touched strings to recall.

Or the young girl married for country's norm
to the wild north, while home vannished as birds.
She swept a touching song in fierce sand storm,
which wept hardest hearts alien to the words.

The soldier's wife waits letter from the far,
Gentle and slow, her tears trembes the strings.
The Master He's last show is like a passing star,
with empire's glories, and all splendid things.

Then I hear Pipa's sorrow sounds again,
and all the stories emerge as a chain.
