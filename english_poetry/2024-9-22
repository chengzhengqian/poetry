賀新郎（賦琵琶） 辛棄疾
鳳尾龍香撥
自開元 霓裳曲罷 幾番風月
最苦潯陽江頭客 畫舸亭亭待發
記出塞 黃雲堆雪
馬上離愁三萬里 望昭陽 宮殿孤鴻沒
弦解語 恨難說

遼陽驛使音塵絕
瑣窗寒 輕攏慢捻 淚珠盈睫
推手含情還卻手 一抹梁州哀徹
千古事 雲飛煙滅
賀老定場無消息 想沉香亭北繁華歇
彈到此 為嗚咽


How deeply Pipa's plaintive music stirred?
When Rainbow Dress foretold an empire's fall.
The exiled poet's woes,  by moonlight spurred,
As soft strings touched, past glories to recall.

The maiden wed for duty, not for love,
To northen wilds, home vannished  as birds.
Her song swept through sand storms that raged above,
Piercing hearts once hard, that knew not her words.

A soldier's wife, her sorrow without end,
Awaits the words from battlefield afar.
Her gentle tears with trembling music blend,
As Master He's last show fades like a star.

Now Pipa's sorrow touches me again,
And all these tales emerge, linked in a chain.
