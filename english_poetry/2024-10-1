漢宮春
山隂 陸游 務觀
來成都作初自南鄭

羽箭雕弓 憶呼鷹古壘 截虎平川
吹笳暮歸野帳 雪壓青氊
淋漓醉墨 看龍蛇 飛落蠻牋
人誤許 詩情將略 一時才氣超然
　
何事又作南來 看重陽藥市 元夕燈山
花時萬人樂處 欹㡌垂鞭
聞歌感舊 尚時時 流涕尊前
君記取 封侯事在 功名不信由天

I still recall those days of bow and arrow.
Guided by hawk's keen eye through drifting snow,
To hunt fierce tigers in their lairs so narrow.
At dusk, triumpant steps did proudly show.

In warm tent's glow, I mixed the fragrant ink.
With cursive script that flowed like tempest's rain,
My verse inspired friends to toast and drink,
And praise my skills and courage, now in vain.

Back south I've come, after long years adrift,
Where spring's festival sturs crowds' buoyant cheer.
My hat worn thin, spur dusty, swift time's gift,
Old songs once sung now draw a sorrowed tear.

No need to bear the slings of other's spite,
Againt blind fate, I'll wage a fiercer fight.
