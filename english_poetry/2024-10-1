漢宮春
山隂 陸游 務觀
來成都作初自南鄭

羽箭雕弓 憶呼鷹古壘 截虎平川
吹笳暮歸野帳 雪壓青氊
淋漓醉墨 看龍蛇 飛落蠻牋
人誤許 詩情將略 一時才氣超然
　
何事又作南來 看重陽藥市 元夕燈山
花時萬人樂處 欹㡌垂鞭
聞歌感舊 尚時時 流涕尊前
君記取 封侯事在 功名不信由天

I still recall the time of sharp arrow
and painted bow, guided by brutal hawk,
to hunt fierce tigers that were hidden in snow.
Sunset then drew shade of my triumph walk.

In warm tent I prepare fragrant ink,
then cursive fonts dropped like fierce storm and rain.
The pretty poem again cheered friends deep drink,
with praise for talents and courage in vain.

I'm back to south after many drift years,
where crowds celebrates festival of spring.
With worn hat, dusty spur, I shed woe's tears,
when hearing the old songs that I used to sing.

There is no need to bear the unfair's hate,
As I will fight againt eye-blinded fate.
