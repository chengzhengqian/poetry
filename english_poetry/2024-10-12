八聲甘州
柳永

對瀟瀟暮雨灑江天，一番洗清秋。
漸霜風淒緊，關河冷落，殘照當樓。
是處紅衰翠減，苒苒物華休。
惟有長江水，無語東流。

不忍登高臨遠，望故鄉渺邈，歸思難收。
歎年來蹤跡，何事苦淹留。
想佳人、妝樓顒望，誤幾回、天際識歸舟。
爭知我、倚闌干處，正恁凝愁。


A waterfall of rain wash off all dirts,
rendering trees and rivers in sharp shades.
As winds turn chill, mounts repose, my heart hurts
when fallen sun gleams on my sorrow's blades.

The force that once drove things to flourish ceased,
As green has vanished and red fades away.
Yet rivers rush ceaselessly to the east,
ignoring my feelings to drift astray.

I ponder why I've wandered all these years,
Fearing the vista when I dare climb high.
My love at home still sheds her longing tears,
Gazing at skyline with hope and sigh.

How oft has she mistaken distant boats?
While in my endless sorrows, my heart floats.
