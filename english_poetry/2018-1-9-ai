The thought in wind
Thinking is the texture of wind,
evolving subtly from time to time,
invisible but to feel  a trembling
in miniature from  mind's eye.

The great finger depatures from heaven,
while lost sheep still searches the rhythm.
I see wits would be glorious as cold stars,
until their bodies vanishes into dark abyss..

Who with this stylus do the light emerges?
The flesh is just canvas to hold the infinity.
O the ancient singing echos in a modern tongue,
with buried lofty walls and statues into empty.
