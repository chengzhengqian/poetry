賀新郎 甚矣吾衰矣 辛棄疾
邑中園亭，僕皆為賦此詞。一日，獨坐停雲，水聲山色，競來相娛，意溪山欲援例者，遂作數語，庶幾仿佛淵明思親友之意雲。

甚矣吾衰矣
悵平生 交遊零落 只今餘幾
白髮空垂三千丈 一笑人間萬事
問何物 能令公喜
我見青山多嫵媚 料青山 見我應如是
情與貌 略相似

一尊搔首東窗裏
想淵明 停雲詩就 此時風味
江左沉酣求名者 豈識濁醪妙理
回首叫 雲飛風起
不恨古人吾不見 恨古人 不見吾狂耳
知我者 二三子

So sad that age has made my body stall,
And lifetime friends are scattered by time's tide.
I care no more for this world's rise and fall,
yet wonder: can delight still here abide?

I see green mountains in a gorgeous way,
and think perhaps they see me just the same.
A brimming bowl of wine brings warmth today,
and I recall Yuanming, the poet with fame.

Those keen to seek Dame Forntune's fickle key,
can never be fond of raw wine's fineness.
I don't hate that ancient poets I can't see,
I hate ancient poets not see my wildness.

So many souls I've met through my liftime,
Yet few echo with my heart's subtle rhyme.
