滿庭芳（夏日溧水無想山作） （周邦彥）

風老鶯雛，雨肥梅子，午陰嘉樹清圓。
地卑山近，衣潤費爐煙。
人靜烏鳶自樂，小橋外、新綠濺濺。
憑欄久，黃蘆苦竹，疑泛九江船。

年年，如社燕，飄流瀚海，來寄修椽。
且莫思身外，長近樽前。
憔悴江南倦客，不堪聽、急管繁弦。
歌筵畔，先安枕簟，容我醉時眠。


The birds have aged in wind, plums sweeten slow
In rain, as noon's round trees cast lucid shade.
The humid air demands more stove fire's glow
to dry my clothes when summer's joy does fade.

The kite and crow enjoys the tranquil pease,
Where men fall silent, green brooklets still sing.
Yet bitter bamboos and yellow reeds,
teach the exiled poet what sorrows can bring.

These drifting years, I've wandered far and wide,
Like a migratory bird never stays,
I cannot bear the music's splendid tide,
When only wine resolves my woes and strays.

Please place my pillow by this buoyant heap,
I'll drink till drunk, then drift to soundest sleep.
