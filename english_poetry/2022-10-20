《甘州·记玉关踏雪事清游》，是南宋词人张炎在宋亡国后的词作，写于1291年（元至元二十八年）。
记玉关、踏雪事清游。
寒气脆貂裘。
傍枯林古道，长河饮马，此意悠悠。
短梦依然江表，老泪洒西州。
一字无题处，落叶都愁。
载取白云归去，问谁留楚佩，弄影中洲。
折芦花赠远，零落一身秋。
向寻常野桥流水，待招来、不是旧沙鸥。
空怀感，有斜阳处，却怕登楼。


The remembrance of the journey in Yuguan with snow

I still remember that journey we all
traveled in snow with crisp fur garment cold.
Ancient path and dry woods stirred feelings tall,
vanished as dream with the shedding tears old.
I try to put all memories to words,
yet sorrow stops me to write like falling leaves.
Driving white clouds and dancing like swift birds,
I hold reed flowers but feel sudden grieves.
Because the old places have no old friends,
and same old scenes deserve no more my pens.


I still remember journey that we all
traveled in snow with thick fur garment cold.
Ancient path crossed dry woods with feelings tall,
vanished as dream with tears became too old.
I try to put the memories to words,
yet sorrow stops me from writing like fall leaf.
Driving white clouds and dancing like swift birds,
I hold reed flowers but feel sudden grief.
Because the old places have no old friends,
and same old scenes deserve no more my pens.
