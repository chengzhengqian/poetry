Chapter 1  Origin of Dao
The purpose of words is so magnificent as the creation of heaven and earth
with peerlessly virtue. Sun and moon enlight successively in high worth,
while moutains and rivers draw their beautiful passage in logic and reasons,
thus is the verse of Dao that rules motion of stars and change of seasons.
When I see the rising of sun or the running of mounts, the high and low are ordered
so do the heaven and earth. And only man can be exclaimed as the third,
in whom the emotion and intelligence are embeded.  We shall call them three art,
with humanity the quintessence of Five Elements and the universe heart.
So the minds give words, and words give verses, and that is the natural transform,
thus do everything, from animal to plants, all show their minds throught their forms.
Long[1] and pheonix show the augury of benediction via their algea-like notion,
Tiger and leopod display swift agility with soft and quick motion.
Cloud and sky blend and carve the colors so splendid that beyond any painter,
Grass and tree scatter the followers so gorgeous that shame every carpenter.
Do all them just merely some decoration? Nay, they are the consequence of nature.
Not to mention the music played by the forests and wind like reed pipe in farewell ,
and so do the spring jumps off the stone like  piano accompanied with metal  bell.
As the form determines the passage, the sound will tell you the verse.
For the things without conscious already have so many wonderful miracles,
why a human who has a senstive mind would not write an impressive articles?
